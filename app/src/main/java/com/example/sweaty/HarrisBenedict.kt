/*
This class implements the Revised Harris-Benedict equation to calculate macro-nutrient needs.

Note: This class utilizes functional programming. That is; every function performs one and
only one task. Complex functionality is achieved by chaining functions together.
Functional programming is both easier to compose than traditional object oriented programming,
and results in fewer errors to the lack of 'side effects'.
